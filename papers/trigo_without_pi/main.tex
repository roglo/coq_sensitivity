\begin{abstract}
We present a construction of trigonometry where angles are not real
numbers, but pairs $(x,y)$ such that $x^2 + y^2 = 1$. Several classic
trigonometric formulas naturally emerge during this construction,
which leads to defining the division of an angle by an integer using a
convergent sequence. This construction does not require the prior
definition of the constant $\pi$, which is never used. All results are
formally proven using the Coq proof assistant.

\section{Basic Construction}

In classical trigonometry, angles are real numbers. The set \( A \) of
angles is therefore defined by

\[
A ::= \mathbb{R}
\]

\noindent Here, we set aside this definition and instead define:

\[
A ::= \{ \; (x, y) \; | \; x^2 + y^2 = 1 \; \}
\]

\noindent In other words, an angle is defined by a point on the unit
circle. This point represents the angle between the positive \( x
\)-axis and the line segment from the origin \( O \) to the point.

\

\noindent The angle \( (x, y) \) is illustrated below:

\

\begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw[thick] (0,0) circle(2);
    \draw[->, thick] (-2.5, 0) -- (2.5, 0);
    \draw[->, thick] (0, -2.5) -- (0, 2.5);
    \node at (-0.2,-0.2) {$O$};

    \pgfmathsetmacro{\px}{cos(30)}
    \pgfmathsetmacro{\py}{sin(30)}
    \coordinate (P) at (\px*2, \py*2);
    \draw[fill] (P) circle (2pt);
    \draw[thick] (0,0) -- (P);
    \draw[thick] (0.6,0) arc[start angle=0, end angle=30, radius=0.6];

    \draw[dotted] (P) -- (\px*2, 0);
    \draw[fill] (\px*2, 0) circle (1pt);
    \node at ({\px*2 - 0.1}, -0.3) {$x$};

    \draw[dotted] (P) -- (0, \py*2);
    \draw[fill] (0, \py*2) circle (1pt);
    \node at (-0.3, {\py*2 - 0.05}) {$y$};
\end{tikzpicture}

\

\

\noindent In our setting, an angle \( \theta \) is not a real number,
but a triple of the form
\[
\theta = (x, y, p),
\]
where \( (x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \), and \( p \) is a proof (or
witness) that \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \); we define:
\[
\cos(\theta) \coloneqq x, \qquad \sin(\theta) \coloneqq y.
\]

\noindent While in classical mathematics, cosine and sine are defined
by power series, here they are just the first two components of the
triplet. The theorem:
\[
\cos^2(\theta) + \sin^2(\theta) = 1
\]
is true by definition: its proof is $p$, the third component of the
triplet.

\

\subsubsection*{Drawback}

The difficulty arises from the arithmetic of angles. In classical
trigonometry, this issue does not appear, since angles are treated as
real numbers. Any operation that is defined on the reals—addition,
subtraction, multiplication, inversion, and so on—is directly
applicable to angles.

However, when we think of angles as points on the unit circle, we can
no longer rely on the standard algebraic operations. These points, in
themselves, do not carry any inherent arithmetic structure. In order
to define such operations, we must construct them from scratch. We
begin with addition in the next section.

\section{Addition of angles}

If we have two angles $(x, y, p)$ and $(x', y', p')$, we want to
define an addition, giving a third angle $(x'', y'', p'')$, such that
$x''^2+y''^2=1$.
\[
(x, y, p) + (x', y', p') ::= (x'', y'', p'')
\]

\

\noindent The solution comes from normal trigonometry. If we have two
angles $a$ and $b$, we now that
\[
cos(a+b) = cos\;a\;.\;cos\;b - sin\;a\;.\;sin\;b
\]
\[
sin(a+b) = sin\;a\;.\;cos\;b + cos\;a\;.\;sin\;b
\]

\

\noindent In our trigonometry, if we consider that the angle $(x, y,
p)$ is ``$a$'', and the angle $(x', y', p')$ is ``$b$'', the angle
$(x'', y'', p'')$ is ``$a + b$''. Applying the classical formulas
above, we can define the addition of angles as
\[
(x, y, p) \boldsymbol{+} (x', y', p') \coloneqq (x x' - y y', x y' + y
x', p'').
\]
where $p''$ is the proof that that the sum of the squares of first two
commponents is 1. This is a consequence of $p$ and $p'$.
